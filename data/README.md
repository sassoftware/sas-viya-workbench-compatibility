## Handwritten Digits

"We used preprocessing programs made available by NIST to extract normalized
bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a total of 43
people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set.
32x32 bitmaps are divided into non-overlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number
of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of
8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces
dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions." - UCI Information

## Mushroom

"This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to
23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp.500-525).
Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of
unknown edibility and not recommended.  This latter class was combined with
the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for
determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like 'leaflets three,
let it be' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy." - UCI description

## Students

The data set includes information known at the time of student enrollment:
academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors. The problem is

and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course.
